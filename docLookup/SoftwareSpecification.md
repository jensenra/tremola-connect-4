## 1. Vision and Goals
Description of the vision and goals that should be solved through the implementation of the system.

* /V10/ Allowing users to connect and initiate a gossip talk easily on the app Tremola
* /G10/ Add a peer discovery tool and an automatic initial handshake


## 2. General Conditions and Stakeholders
Description of organizational framework: areas of application, target groups, operating conditions

* /S10/ Tremola Users
* /S20/ Tremola Contributors & Developers
* /C10/ Project is part of android App to connect peers using Secure Scuttlebutt
* /C20/ Project runs on any Android phone running on targeted version of the OS 
* /C30/ Project is capable of running multi-year

## 3. Context and Overview
Definition of the relevant system environment (context) and system overview

* /O10/ Project is written in Kotlin, Java and Javascript
* /O20/ Project is sourced on GitHub

## 4. Functional Requirements
The core functionality of the system is to be described from the client's point of view on the
highest abstraction level.

* /F10/ The system must offer the possibility to initiate a peer discovery query on the GUI
* /F20/ The Shortname (hash of the public key) of the Target peer must be sufficient to 
  initiate a peer discovery query 
* /F30/ The system must not recognize Shortname that do not match the correct pattern
* /F40/ The peer discovery sends broadcast messages
* /F50/ The code allows an easy addition of new means to reach peers, including Bluetooth
* /F60/ A peer receiving the query must understand it
* /F70/ If the Target is in the receiving peer's contact list or if he is the Target himself, he 
  can answer the query by delivering the queried data to the Initiator
* /F80/ If the receiving peer doesn't know the Target's public key, he can forward it
* /F90/ The receiving peer can forward it on any channel that he knows, not only the one that received the query
* /F100/ The system must be able to choose between two answers
* /F110/ The system should be able in the future to give the user the option not to forward any query
* /F120/ The system should be able in the future to give the user the option not to automatically add a peer found by a lookup

The functional requirements can be determined with the help of use cases. The use cases should be described in detail in Appendix A.

## 5. Non-functional Requirements
A quality target determination for the system should be made using a table

| System Quality  | very good | good | normal | not relevant |
|-----------------|-----------|------|--------|--------------|
| Functionality   |           | x    |        |              |
| Reliability     |           | x    |        |              |
| Usability       |           |      | x      |              |
| Efficiency      |           |      | x      |              |
| Maintainability |           | x    |        |              |
| Portability     |           |      | x      |              |

Individual requirements can be defined as follows:

* /N10/ The functionality should be an enhancement to already existing peering functionality of Tremola

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria determine how requirements can be checked for their implementation before acceptance

* /A10/ The front-end allows a user to enter a shortname to start a request
* /A20/ The front-end refuses a request and notify the user of the shortname does not have the correct format
* /A30/ A new contact is added in case of a successful lookup
* /A40/ The user gets notified in case of an unsuccessful lookup, i.e. when the timer goes off 
* /A50/ The feature and functional changes are documented in the source code via Javadocs

## 7. Glossary
*lookup*: The process of searching for a peer with the help of a shortname.
*shortname*: A 10 character word, split in two by a '-', that is computed from the public key (unique identifier) of a user.
*Initiator*: The initiator peer of the lookup.
*Target*: The user that the Initiator wants to peer with.
*Friend*: A peer that knows the public key of the Target.
*Tremola App*: The [Tremola Android App](https://github.com/etienne428/tremola), a Secure Scuttlebutt client that supports private chat

## Appendix A. Use-cases

### Initiator's point of view, invalid query

#### Use Case 1:
* Name - *The Initiator tries to send an invalid shortname*
* Actors - *Tremola App, Initiator*
* Prerequisite - *The Initiator has a phone with the appropriate version of the Tremola App*
* Standard flow -
    * The Initiator open the Lookup tab in the Contact menu
    * The Initiator types an invalid shortname and click and the 'checked' button
* Result (Success) - *The Initiator gets a notification that the shortname is not valid*
* Result (Failure) - *The frontend sends the (invalid) shortname to the backend; No notification appears*

#### Use Case 2:
* Name - *The Initiator tries to query his own shortname*
* Actors - *Tremola App, Initiator*
* Prerequisite - *The Initiator has a phone with the appropriate version of the Tremola App*
* Standard flow -
  * The Initiator open the Lookup tab in the Contact menu
  * The Initiator types his own shortname and click and the 'checked' button
* Result (Success) - *The Initiator gets a notification that the shortname is his own*
* Result (Failure) - *The query is sent; No notification appears*

#### Use Case 3:
* Name - *The Initiator tries to send a shortname that is already in the database*
* Actors - *Tremola App, Initiator*
* Prerequisite - *The Initiator has a phone with the appropriate version of the Tremola App*
* Standard flow -
  * The Initiator open the Lookup tab in the Contact menu
  * The Initiator types a valid shortname and click and the 'checked' button
